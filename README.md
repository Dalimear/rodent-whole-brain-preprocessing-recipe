# Rodents Whole Brain fMRI Data Preprocessing Toolbox
This pipeline has been tested on 4 different fMRI whole brain group datasets of rodents with different imaging protocols and experimental conditions (3 rats groups and 1 mice group) to demonstrate the robustness.

## Prerequisite software
1. FSL5.0, AFNI and ANTs--can be installed on a PC by following "SoftwareInstallation_fsl_afni_ants.txt"
2. PCNN3d toolbox in Matlab (optional for mice brain preprocessing, see below for details).
